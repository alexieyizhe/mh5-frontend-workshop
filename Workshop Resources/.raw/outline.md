==**Target Audience:**== Beginner coders, newcomers to programming

==__Recommended Prerequisites/Knowledge:__== None required, some basic knowledge of coding will be useful

#### Content Breakdown

1. **Introduction**
   - Short description of what we'll be doing in the workshop (bit of theory, then practical learning by building a personal site)
   - Background of myself
2. **Theory**
   - How the frontend of websites are built, deployed, served (basically the process a site goes through from developer to user)
   - Most commonly used technologies in frontend web dev (HTML, CSS, sometimes JS)
3. **Setup** (basically tell them to start getting their hands dirty)
4. **HTML**
   - Explanation of HTML tags and props, their functionalities, and behaviour
   - Designing our personal site with a sectional mindset (encourage them to think in components/split site into functionality or pieces)
5. **CSS**
   - Integrating CSS with HTML (`id`, `class`, selectors)
   - Integrating simple style changes to existing elements on your page (color, size, font-family, etc)
   - Designing a non-linear site with layout changes (`position`, `display`, `padding`/`margin`, possibly `zindex` or `flexbox`?)
   - Animations & transitions (time permitting)
6. **Taking it one step further**
   - Frameworks for web development (React, Vue, Ruby on Rails)
   - Integrations with a backend
   - Dynamic sites/web apps
   - Mobile responsive design, PWAs



## Frontend Workshop: Walkthrough

### Introduction

- What we'll be doing:
  1. A bit of theory
     1. Technical stuff
     2. Technologies used on the web
     3. How everything works and fits together on the front-end
  2. Building and deploying a simple personal website
     - example on Github
- Alex, your host for the Intro to Frontend workshop
- Background about myself:
  - 2nd year CS @ UW
  - Previous co-op at Flipp, mostly backend
  - Other experience: Equithon, Hack the North, TEDxUW
  - Mentor at MH5, come talk to me about stuff
- Instructions, outline, final product on github as well

### Theory

- What frontend web dev consists of:
  - Building the pages and interfaces that a user will see when they visit a website
  - Working with designers to make the web look nice
  - Creating dynamic apps and experiences (getting more prevalent)
- On the developer side:
  - Creating a website:
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - JS
  - Deploying and hosting a website
    - Web servers
    - Hosting services
    - Domain name & DNS
- On the user side:
  - Terminology
  - Viewing a website
    - Web browsers
      - 
    - URLs and navigation
      - 
    - Resolving DNS 
      - 
    - Fetching assets from server
      - 
    - Displaying the site
      - 
    - Sending data back
      - 
  - Dynamic vs. static sites
    - Dynamic websites:
      - often respond to user input
      - built like apps
      - 2 way communication with a server to store data, perform actions, etc
      - Requires development of a backend
    - Static sites 
      - You ask for a website by typing in the URL, server on host provides a preloaded page, sends it to your web browser to be displayed
      - No backend even needed most of the time
      - Often won't need to communicate back to the host
- Since this is a frontend workshop, we'll be making a static site
  - Going through the entire process, from coding, styling, deploying, and hosting (if you have a GitHub account)



### Setup

1. Create a folder, call it whatever you want.
2. [Optional] If you know how to use git and want to keep track of what we build in this workshop, you might want to `git init` and then `git commit` as appropriate throughout.
3. Create the following files in the folder:
   - `index.html`
   - `index.css`
4. You're ready to go!

==Checkpoint:== You should be able to start writing code for the final product.



### HTML: The Foundation

- Overview of HTML
  - Website is broken up into small pieces, known formally as **components**
  - HTML allows you to define blocks and pieces that make up a page on your website as **elements**
  - Start thinking about websites as built from tiny components
    - Reusability
    - DRY
    - Single responsibility principle
  - Syntax for:
    - Elements
    - Props
- Start writing code
  - ??
  - ??

==Checkpoint:== By this point, attendees should have the basic structure of the final product.



### CSS: The Decorations

- Overview of CSS
  - Why do you need it?
  - Abilities
    - Changing layout, moving stuff around
    - Changing look (color, size, shape)
    - Selective application of styles (hover, pseudoelements)
- Applying styles
  - Selectors
  - Properties
- Start styling
  - ??
  - ??
- Advanced CSS concepts
  - Animations
  - Transitions
  - Media queries
  - Pseudoelements
  - Advanced selectors
  - Etc

==Checkpoint:== By this point, attendees should have the layout and look of the final product.



### JavaScript: The Functionality

- Similar to other programming languages, but native to the web
- Simple JS to modify an element on our website
- Can do more, but not today



### Going Live [OPTIONAL]

- Host on Github Pages:
  1. Commit & push to repository
  2. Navigate to repository page > settings
  3. Enable Github pages
  4. Eventually, see your website live!
- How does this connect the theory and the application?

==Checkpoint:== By this point, attendees should have a live version of the final product, fully interactive and viewable on the internet.



### Taking It One Step Further

- Building on modifying one element with JS: why not the entire page?
- Frontend frameworks
  - JQuery
  - React
  - Vue.js
- Integrating with a backend
  - REST APIs
  - Backend development
- Mobile 
  - Responsive design
  - PWAs
  - Native apps
